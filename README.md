# AXiom PKG
Axiom PKG - open for improvement and user-friendly package manager for Linux!

# How does it work?

The package manager compiles packages from GitHub and Git from scratch, no closed repositories, only proven programs. All repositories for installation are in the .axiomrc config. The config indicates everything that needs to be done to install any package. You can easily change this package manager or add other, alternative packages. The package manager is suitable for any Linux distribution, but I do not yet control dependencies.

# How to download and use?

`git clone https://github.com/kpah2008/axiom-pkg`

`cd axiom-pkg`

`sudo make install`



To use the program, write `axpkg update`. It will create and update the configuration.
